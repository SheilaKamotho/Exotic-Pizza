# Exotic Pizza
## Description
This is a webpage for a pseudo-company, Exotic Pizza, aimed at assessing my HTML, CSS, BootStrap, and jQuery skills at Moringa School. It contains a page with the company name and logo, a menu section and a summary page that shows when one makes an order.
Attached is the link to the Exotic Pizza Webpage:https://sheilakamotho.github.io/Exotic-Pizza/

## BDD
 1. Create a mental picture about what the webpage is supposed to look like and its functioning.
(a) A page with the company name, photos of some past work, ordering form with size, crust, toppings and delivery option, summary of order that shows after submission of the order.
 2. Create necessary folders and files, write HTML basic structure and fill in the content, write functions on JavaScript file while formulating IDs for the functions in the HTML page, style using bootstrap and CSS.
 3. Keep making improvements on the website.
## Bugs
